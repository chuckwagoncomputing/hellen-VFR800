bumpThis repo contains files to build a standalone plug and play RusEFI Hellen based ECU for a 99 Honda VFR800. The prototype is unfinished and currently none of these files can be used to make a functioning ECU

A quick look at the wiring diagrams suggest this hardware should also be compatible with the CBR600F4i, CBR929RR, and 01-03 CBR1100xx  if the ECU connectors were repinned.

In addition to the above it may be able to replace the ignition module/ECU of a 98-08 VT1100C, 01-07 VT750DC, 02-04 VTX1800, RC51, and 2003-09 VTX1300 with some harness repinning

Features in progress as of v0.03:

Drop in ECU replacement for 99-01 VFR800 with addition of 2 wideband oxygen sensors

4x sequential ignition/injection

CANBUS

2x Wideband oxygen sensor channels

3x lowside driver output on rear connector

Inputs for analog sensor on rear connector

USB support

Bluetooth connectivity

MicroSD card for logging

VSS input to ECU for eventual implementation of traction control
