This repo contains files to build a standalone plug and play RusEFI Hellen based ECU for a 99 Honda VFR800. The prototype is unfinished and currently none of these files can be used to make a functioning ECU

A quick look at the wiring diagrams suggest this hardware should also be compatible with the CBR600F4i, CBR929RR, and 01-03 CBR1100xx  if the ECU connectors were repinned.

In addition to the above it may be able to replace the ignition module/ECU of a 98-08 VT1100C, 01-07 VT750DC, 02-04 VTX1800, RC51, and 2003-09 VTX1300 with some harness repinning

Features in progress as of v0.03:

Drop in ECU replacement for 99-01 VFR800 with addition of 2 wideband oxygen sensors

4x sequential ignition/injection

CANBUS

2x Wideband oxygen sensor channels

3x lowside driver output on rear connector

Inputs for flex fuel/other analog sensors on rear connector

USB support

Bluetooth connectivity

MicroSD card for logging

VSS input to ECU for eventual implementation of traction control
